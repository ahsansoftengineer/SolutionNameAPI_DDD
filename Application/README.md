# APPLICATION

> This layer doesn’t contain business logic. It’s the part that leads the user from one to another UI screen. It also interacts with application layers of other systems. It can perform simple validation but it contains no domain-related logic or data access. Its purpose is to organize and delegate domain objects to do their job. Moreover, it’s the only layer accessible to other bounded contexts.
